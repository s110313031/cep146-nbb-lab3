## Ingredients
* 1 cup (226 g) unsalted butter, softened

* 3/4 cup (150 g) granulated sugar

* 3/4 cup (165 g) brown sugar, packed

* 2 large eggs, room temperature

* 1 tsp vanilla extract

* 2 1/4 cups (280 g) all-purpose flour

* 1 tsp baking soda

* 1/2 tsp fine salt

* 2 cups (340 g) chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Cream butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy (2–3 minutes).

2. Beat in eggs one at a time, then add vanilla.

3. Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt; add to wet ingredients and mix just until combined.

4. Fold in chocolate chips.

5. Scoop 2 Tbsp portions onto lined baking sheets, spacing ~2 in (5 cm) apart.

6. Bake 10–12 minutes, until edges are set and centers look slightly soft.

7. Cool on the sheet 5 minutes, then transfer to a rack.

## Notes

* Chewier: Chill dough 30–60 minutes before baking.

* Crispier: Bake 1–2 minutes longer.

* Optional add-ins: 1 cup chopped nuts or swap half the chips for chunks.
